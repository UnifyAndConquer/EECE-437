Assignment 1: an FSM that can be built declaratively by a user. The states, ports, transitions, conditions and actions that make it up are declared and inputted to the FSM object.

Assignment 2: a system of FSMs linked by interactions and ports. an interaction executes only if all its ports are enabled and its condition is enabled. An interaction can perform an action over some system variables. A port p is enabled if there exists a port in some valid transition in the FSM equal to p.
